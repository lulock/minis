# This is my first Mini. Today I will simulate rolling dice :)

# Dice Rolling Simulator

# Objective: write a program that simulates rolling dice. 
# When the program runs, it will ask to determine how many sides you would like your dice to have
# It will then prompt you to roll when you're 'ready' and depict that it is loading as the dice 'rolls'
# It should then ask you if youâ€™d like to roll again. 

# Concepts to keep in mind:
# Random
# Integer
# Print
# While Loops
# Handling Exceptions
# Handling inputs
# Time

# Future considerations for this Mini project:
# package random roll into a function that limits the max number of sides
# function to handle multiple dice rolls and print the sum
# capture record of all rolls and return a plot of the distribution when asked

# generate random integer values
#from random import seed
from random import randint
import time
# seed random number generator
#seed(1)
