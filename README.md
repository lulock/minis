# :candy: Minis :candy:
This is my repository of mini Python projects.

## Mini #1: Rolling dice :game_die:
In this dice rolling simulator, my objective is pretty self-explanatory: write a programme that simulates rolling dice. 
When executed, the programme will ask to determine how many sides you would like your dice to have. It will then prompt you to roll when ready and load as the dice 'rolls'. After displaying the rolled value, the programme will ask you if youâ€™d like to roll again. 

### Concepts within this mini:
- Random
- Integer
- Print
- While Loops
- Handling Exceptions
- Handling inputs
- Time

## Mini #2: Mad Libs! :stuck_out_tongue_closed_eyes:
In this programme, the user is prompted to input certain word classes, like a noun, adjective, etc. A word list is accumulated and then the final text is printed with the user's suggested words in place of the blanks. Only one mad lib text is available.

### Concepts within this mini:
- String
- Dictionary
- Print
- Loops
- Handling inputs
- Time

## Mini #3: Rock :gem: ... Paper :page_facing_up: ... Scissors :scissors:
In this programme, the user plays a game of Rock, Paper, Scissors with a computer. The computer generates one of the options at random per round. The game ends once one player reaches 3 points.

## Mini #4: WHAT DO YOU MEME? :speech_balloon:
As my friends and I look for our go-to boardgames online, I decide to take a shot at stitching one of our favourites using Python: What Do You Meme? For now, this program will shuffle a "deck" of memes and a "deck" of texts to match. Display a meme image, deal 3 text cards to the player and request them to choose the most appropriate text to match the image for a final meme. The selected text will then print on top of the image and display the final composition.

### Concepts within this mini:

## Mini # 6: Koch Curve and Fun with Fractals using Turtle :turtle:
I came across fractals again yesterday and thought it would be a good Mini to code using Python's Turtle graphics library. A Fractal in mathematics is a curve or geometric shape that is made up of self-similar subsets. Fractals emerge frequently in nature, like in snowflakes. Fractal __dimension__ can be used to describe surface roughness (like the geographic borders of my 6th grade fictional island - Serendipity :woman_facepalming:) They are also very mathemagical and pretty and can be coded nicely using recursive functions!

### Concepts within this mini:
- Turtle
- Recursion
- Color
