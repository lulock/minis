This is my repository of mini Python projects.

## Mini #1: Rolling dice :game_die:
In this dice rolling simulator, my objective is pretty self-explanitory: write a programme that simulates rolling dice. 
When executed, the programme will ask to determine how many sides you would like your dice to have. It will then prompt you to roll when ready and load as the dice 'rolls'. After displaying the rolled value, the programme will ask you if youâ€™d like to roll again. 

### Concepts within this mini:
- Random
- Integer
- Print
- While Loops
- Handling Exceptions
- Handling inputs
- Time
